2. Click on "Create table"
3. Enter the table name (e.g., "clients")
4. Specify the number of columns (you can add more later)
5. Click "Go"
6. Define each column with:
   - Name (e.g., "client_id")
   - Type (e.g., "INT")
   - Length/Values (e.g., "11")
   - Default (e.g., "None")
   - Collation (for text fields)
   - Attributes (e.g., "UNSIGNED")
   - Null (allowed or not)
   - Index (PRIMARY, UNIQUE, INDEX)
   - Auto increment (for primary keys)
   - Comments (optional)
7. Click "Save"

### Example Queries

Here are some example queries for the JRS database context:

**Retrieve all clients from a specific country:**
```sql
SELECT 
    client_id, 
    CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS client_name, 
    registration_date 
FROM 
    clients 
WHERE 
    nationality = 'Myanmar' 
ORDER BY 
    registration_date DESC;
```

**Count clients by nationality:**
```sql
SELECT 
    nationality, 
    COUNT(*) AS client_count 
FROM 
    clients 
GROUP BY 
    nationality 
ORDER BY 
    client_count DESC;
```

**Join tables to get service information:**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.first_name, 
    c.last_name, 
    s.service_name, 
    sd.delivery_date 
FROM 
    clients c
JOIN 
    service_delivery sd ON c.client_id = sd.client_id
JOIN 
    services s ON sd.service_id = s.service_id

## Practical Applications for JRS Database

Let's explore some practical ways phpMyAdmin can be used for the JRS database:

### 1. Database Design and Documentation

phpMyAdmin can help visualize and document the JRS database structure:

1. Use the "Structure" tab to view table definitions
2. Use the "Designer" feature (available in the drop-down menu under "More") to view relationships between tables
3. Export the database structure as a PDF or image for documentation

### 2. Data Quality Assessment

To check data quality and consistency:

1. Use SQL queries to find incomplete records
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM clients WHERE nationality IS NULL OR nationality = '';
   ```

2. Check for duplicate records
   ```sql
   SELECT first_name, last_name, COUNT(*) 
   FROM clients 
   GROUP BY first_name, last_name 
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

3. Look for outliers or suspicious data
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM service_delivery 
   WHERE delivery_date > CURRENT_DATE OR delivery_date < '2020-01-01';
   ```

### 3. Report Generation

To generate reports for JRS management:

1. Write SQL queries to extract the needed data
2. Export the results as CSV files for further processing in Excel
3. Save bookmarks for frequently used report queries

### 4. Database Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks you can perform:

1. Check table sizes to monitor database growth
2. Optimize tables to improve performance
3. Repair tables if corrupted
4. Run CHECK TABLE queries to verify data integrity

## Potential Enhancements to JRS Database

Based on your assessment of the current database, you might identify opportunities for enhancement:

### Schema Improvements
